# Colemak Programmer (Colemakger) TADA68 layout
This is the Colemak (vs QWERTY) layout for the TADA68, plus:
* `Left Shift` and `Right Shift` when held, `(` and `)` when tapped.
* `Caps Lock` is as normal when tapped, but `FN` when held.
* Backlight keys rearranged to make them easier to remember:
  * `FN-B`: Backlight on (B for Backlight)
  * `FN-V`: Backlight up
  * `FN-C`: Backlight down
  * No real mnemonics for C and V aside from being proximate to B.
* Volume keys rearranged to make them easier to remember:
  * `FN-M`: Mute (M for Mute)
  * `FN-,`: Vol Down (legend < === less volume)
  * `FN-.`: Vol Up (legend > === more volume)
* `PgDn` is swapped for `Home` and `PgDn` for `End`
  * As a programmer I find I use `Home`/`End` way more than `PgUp` / `PgDn`.
* FN-[ sets Colemak as the default layer (non-persistent / this is the default)
* FN-] sets QWERTY as the default layer (non-persistent)
